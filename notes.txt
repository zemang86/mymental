I see! The detailed assessment (/test/[type]/page.tsx) has a TODO at line 107-108:
  // In production, save to API
  // await fetch('/api/v1/assessment/detailed', { ... });

  The results page works fine - it reads score/severity from URL params. But the results are not saved to the database yet.

  MVP Gaps Summary

  | Gap                                    | Priority | Effort |
  |----------------------------------------|----------|--------|
  | Save detailed assessment results to DB | Critical | Small  |
  | About page                             | Low      | Small  |
  | Resources page                         | Low      | Small  |
  | OG Image                               | Medium   | Small  |

  Want me to:
  1. Fix the critical gap - Wire up saving assessment results to Supabase
  2. Create the missing pages - About + Resources
  3. Both

  The fix for saving to DB is quick - just need to uncomment and implement that API call in the assessment page.
