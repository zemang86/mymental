[15/12/2025, 22:37:01] ~ Sarah Aleesa: Anyway, I just tried the mymental link you gave us
[15/12/2025, 22:37:06] ~ Sarah Aleesa: Basically thats the concept
[15/12/2025, 22:39:25] ~ Sarah Aleesa: Except the self learning intervention needs to be interactive (videos, animation, quizzes etc) instead using all words. And kena ada offline intervention also for users with high risk. 

And, before getting the assessment result in their email, they need to pay first which kena ada payment getaway. Then baru go intervention
[15/12/2025, 22:40:51] ~ Sarah Aleesa: 1st screening (shows surface result) - FOC
2nd screening + result + intervention - kena start bayar
[15/12/2025, 22:42:00] ~ Sarah Aleesa: And just now i tried by giving good scoring. I takut if i try negative items, nanti keluar red indications pulak again and cannot go back
